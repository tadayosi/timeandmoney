Eric Evans has been the primary developer and designer of TimeLanguage.
Martin Fowler contributed the initial version of what became CalendarDate
and some nice unit tests for TimeInterval.
Benny Sadeh contributed the initial version of BusinessCalendar and TimeUnit, and
did some refactoring on the code base.
Vlad Gitlevich and John Corbett each acted as programming pairs.
Alan Lovejoy, years ago, helped clarify the TimePoint/Duration/Interval distinction.
