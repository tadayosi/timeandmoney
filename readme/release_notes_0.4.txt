Changes from 0.3 to 0.4
-----------------------
Folder reorganization: 
The module has been renamed to TimeAndMoney. The folders within the project have
been reorganized for convenience of developers and users.

Build Script: 
An Ant script can be found in the project's root directory which can do a clean
build and test, and also creates a library JAR.


Target Users for Release 0.4
----------------------------
Release 0.4 of this code is intended for use on projects by developers who are 
interested in helping the development of the library and are prepared to deal with 
the immaturity of the code and design. Not only will defects in the code be fixed 
in later versions, there will be radical changes to the design, based on the
feedback of these early users. These design changes will not all be backward
compatible.
With that caveat, the library in its current state should provide value.
In release 0.4, the time package is becoming fairly usable. Money is rougher, but
the basic data structure of the Money object is unlikely to change much.


Java Version Requirement: 1.4
-----------------------------
Currency:  
The money package depends on the java.util.Currency class. This dependency
could be eliminated by adding a Currency class to the library. For now, it seems
simpler to use what the Sun provided.

BigDecimal:
The money package depends on java.math.BigDecimal, which has been around for
a while, but is not available in some varieties of JDK, such as J2Me.

assert: 
Many methods state preconditions using Java assert statement, which is ignored,
by default, in 1.4, but will not compile in earlier Java versions. To build without errors,
set all the jdk compliance levels to 1.4. To compile for earlier versions, comment
out the assert statements. The code will still behave correctly.
