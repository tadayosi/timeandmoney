Release 0.1 of this code is intended for use on projects who are interested
in helping the development of the library and are prepared to deal with the
immaturity of the code and design. Not only will defects in the code be fixed 
in later versions, there will be radical changes to the design, based on the
feedback of these early users. These design changes will not all be backward
compatible.

With that caveat, the library in its current state should provide value.
Some useful, and perhaps not obvious, features of the current library include:
- ComparableInterval (and its "concrete" subclass) which can be used for any
objects that implement Comparable. For example, if you have Money class, and
want to check ranges, implement Comparable on the Money class and make an
interval.
